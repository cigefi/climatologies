{"name":"Climatologies","tagline":"","body":"# Climatologies\r\nThis script is capable of reading recursively a bunch of netcdf files and generate 3 types of climatologies: daily, monthly, and seasonal.\r\nThe unique requirement for the data is to be organized in the following structure:<br/>\r\n[EXPERIMENT NAME]<br/>\r\n------ [MONITORING DATA]<br/>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------ ####.nc<br />\r\n\r\nTo obtain this file structure, you can use [fileOrganize.sh](https://github.com/cigefi/fileManager/) script.\r\n\r\n### Daily (default mode)\r\n##### Input\r\n- (Required) dirName: Path of the directory that contains the files and path to save the output files (cell array)\r\n- (Optional) type: daily\r\n- (Optional) var2Read: Variable to be read (use 'ncdump -h' command from bash to get the variable names\r\n- (Optional) yearZero: Lower year of the data to be read (integer)\r\n- (Optional) yearN: Higher year of the data to be readed (integer)\r\n\r\n##### Output (3 files)\r\n- log file: File that contains the list of property processed .nc files and the errors\r\n- [Experiment-Name]-[var2Read].dat file: File that contains a 2-Dimensional structure with the values point by point\r\n- [Experiment-Name].eps file: File that contains a plot of the data in high resolution\r\n\r\n##### Function invocation\r\nReads all the .nc files from _SOURCE_PATH_ and generates daily climatology\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]})\r\n```\r\nSame as above\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'daily')\r\n```\r\nReads all the .nc files wich contain the variable _pr_ from _SOURCE_PATH_ and generates daily climatology\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'daily','pr')\r\n```\r\nSame as above, plus the maximum data to be read is from the year 1950\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'daily','pr',1950)\r\n```\r\nSame as above, but the data to be read is from the range 1950 to 2000\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'daily','pr',1950,2000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Monthly\r\n##### Input\r\n- (Required) dirName: Path of the directory that contains the files and path to save the output files (cell array)\r\n- (Optional) type: monthly\r\n- (Optional) var2Read: Variable to be read (use 'ncdump -h' command from bash to get the variable names\r\n- (Optional) yearZero: Lower year of the data to be read (integer)\r\n- (Optional) yearN: Higher year of the data to be readed (integer)\r\n\r\n##### Output (25 files)\r\n- log file: File that contains the list of property processed .nc files and the errors\r\n- [Experiment-Name]-[Month].dat file: File that contains a 2-Dimensional structure with the values point by point\r\n- [Experiment-Name]-[Month].eps file: File that contains a plot of the data in high resolution\r\n\r\n##### Function invocation\r\nReads all the .nc files from _SOURCE_PATH_ and generates monthly climatology\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'monthly')\r\n```\r\nReads all the .nc files wich contain the variable _pr_ from _SOURCE_PATH_ and generates monthly climatology\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'monthly','pr')\r\n```\r\nSame as above, plus the maximum data to be read is from the year 1950\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'monthly','pr',1950)\r\n```\r\nSame as above, but the data to be read is from the range 1950 to 2000\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'monthly','pr',1950,2000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Seasonal\r\n##### Input\r\n- (Required) dirName: Path of the directory that contains the files and path to save the output files (cell array)\r\n- (Optional) type: seasonal\r\n- (Optional) var2Read: Variable to be read (use 'ncdump -h' command from bash to get the variable names\r\n- (Optional) yearZero: Lower year of the data to be read (integer)\r\n- (Optional) yearN: Higher year of the data to be readed (integer)\r\n\r\n##### Output (10 files)\r\n- log file: File that contains the list of property processed .nc files and the errors\r\n- [Experiment-Name]-[Season].dat file: File that contains a 2-Dimensional structure with the values point by point\r\n- [Experiment-Name]-[Season].eps file: File that contains a plot of the data in high resolution\r\n\r\n##### Function invocation\r\nReads all the .nc files from _SOURCE_PATH_ and generates seasonal climatology\r\n```matlab\r\nclimatology({[SOURCE_PATH],[SAVE_PATH]},'seasonal')\r\n```\r\nReads all the .nc files wich contain the variable _pr_ from _SOURCE_PATH_ and generates seasonal
